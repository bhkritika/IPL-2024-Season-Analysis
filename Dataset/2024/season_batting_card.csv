Seems destined to angle in but straightens just a shade after pitching. Prabhsimran walks down the track and looks to whip it away over mid wicket. Skews it off the leading edge, and Nitish, running back from cover point, gobbles it up. SRH have two in the powerplay!",

A blinder by Cummins at mid off!</strong> Hard length outside off, and this seems to rush off the pitch quicker than Curran anticipates. Hacks across the line and mistimes it. For the longest while, it seems it will evade Cummins at mid off until....he leaps up like a salmon high to his left and takes it with both hands. What a moment in the game, and SRH's captain has come up trumps!",
