""He has handed over captaincy to Gaikwad, <b>but he's still Chennai's <i>Thala</i></b>. The chants of ""Dhoni!Dhoni!Dhoni!"" and the whistles for him are getting louder and louder. It looks very much like these 14 matches - 16 or 17 if luck is once again on his side - are very much the beginning of the end. At the same time, the crowd is warming up to the new captain Gaikwad. Once, another Gaikwad with Maharashtrian roots, a certain Shivaji Rao, went on to become a household name in Chennai. That's some way away, but for now Gaikwad has the keys to the Chennai kingdom. A huge replica of the IPL trophy now makes its way into the middle. The LED lights are also being tested out ahead of the opening ceremony, which will include performances of AR Rahman and Prabhu Deva.""</p>

<p><strong>6.25pm</strong> The last time CSK and RCB played the opening game of an IPL season, RCB were <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2019-1165643/chennai-super-kings-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-1st-match-1175356/full-scorecard"">rolled over for 70</a>, and it took CSK 17.4 overs to chase the target down. RCB will want to right that wrong. But can they? CSK have three spin options in Maheesh Theekshana, Ravindra Jadeja and part-timer Rachin Ravindra on what could be another slow pitch. In contrast, RCB don't have a world-class spinner in their ranks. Here's Deivarayan Muthu with the <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/chennai-super-kings-vs-royal-challengers-bengaluru-1st-match-1422119/match-preview"">match preview</a>.</p><p>Pawas: ""The first true transitional season of IPL is about to kick off"" Really feels that way, isn't?

And make no mistake, it's going to be a sea of Yellow at the Chepauk. There will be an opening ceremony with all the glitz and glamour in full flow. Once the dust settles, RCB will try and get the better of CSK at a venue where they haven't had a lot of success. In fact, just once in nine attempts - that one coming way back in 2008. Can they change history?</p>

The latest captaincy change is a good place, I reckon. A day before the IPL begins, defending champions CSK have a new captain - Ruturaj Gaikwad. Yep.

It's a double-header tomorrow and we will be live nice and early to bring all the action. Till then, this is me Ashish signing off on behalf of Sidharth, Thilak and Chandan. Ciao!</p><p><b>Mustafizur Rahman is the player of the match for his 4 for 29. </b></p><p><b>CSK captain, Ruturaj Gaikwad:</b> Total control right from the start. 2-3 overs here and there but once the spinners came on, we were in control. 10-15 runs lesser would have been great but they came back well. [Turning point?] To get Maxwell and even Faf out, the quick wickets were the turning point. Helps to control the next five-six overs. That was the main point. [Captaincy debut] I have always enjoyed it. Haven't felt the additional pressure, right from the state side. Not even a single time I felt pressurized by anything. Obviously had Mahi <i>bhai</i> with me. [On the chase] Everyone is a stroke-player in our side, even Jinx. There is role clarity in the batting unit. Helps a lot. Lots of positives, but two-three things to work on. The batting, everyone chipped in. If we had a few batters from the top-order batting through, the chase would have been easier. </p><p>Presentation time. </p><p><b>Some stat nuggets from Sampath:</b> </p><p>- This is the 8th consecutive win for CSK vs RCB at Chepauk, the longest winning streak for any team against an opponent at a venue in IPL. Next best streak is for MI, who have won their last seven matches vs KKR at Wankhede.</p><p>- Ravindra Jadeja unbeaten in a successful IPL chase for the 27th time, joint-most by any batter, alongside MS Dhoni. </p><p>Amey: ""Credit to Jadeja for playing only 2 dot balls and keeping the scoreboard moving, especially when Dube was struggling.""</p><p>Afeef: ""RCB needed a better plan than just bowling short balls. Alzarri could've been used better, I feel.""</p><p><b>Rachin Ravindra</b>: Pretty complete performance by us. We held our nerves. Batting with Jinx [Rahane] and Rutu, very calm heads. Lucky we had 4-5 days of good training. I find it easier going from red ball to white ball because I think the positions are the same, [Form] It's been good. The wickets were a bit different in training but I backed myself in the game. The experience of the amazing crowd was great. Helps a lot. </p><p><b>Faf du Plessis</b>: You have to get ahead in the first six overs. Chennai squeeze you with their spinners. We lost too many wickets in the first six overs. We were 15-20 runs short on a pitch that wasn't as bad as we played in the first ten overs We were always a little bit behind trying to get ahead of the game. They were always ahead of the game. [Short ball plan] Dube wasn't comfortable with the short ball, we were trying to get a few wickets in the middle overs. But didn't happen. [Batting first] If you look at the stats, it is very in favour of batting first. It looked a bit on the drier side. The spinners, in the second innings, the ball started to grip a bit. We backed our seamers against Dube. But batting first was the right decision. [On DK and Rawat] Really good for Dinesh setting up the season for someone who hasn't really played a lot of cricket in the last year. Really important knock for himself. Rawat showed some really promise even last year. He showed composure. </p><p><b>11.55pm</b>And the wait continues. That is eight wins on the bounce for CSK against RCB at Chepauk. And a clinical win it was to kick-off IPL 2024. It was Rachin Ravindra, on IPL debut, who gave the chase a flying start with a 15-ball 37. Rahane also did his bit scoring a quick 27. RCB did come back into the game with a few quick wickets as they adopted the short ball plan. But I felt they over-did it. Dube was clearly struggling initially, but once he survived, run-scoring was easy. Jadeja did his bit in rotating the strike, and eventually CSK got home with eight balls to spare. While RCB's middle order collapsed, CSK had all their batters contributing. And that was the difference between the two teams.</p>"

Says the pitch is rock-hard and it's a black-soil track, not a lot of grass, which means there won't be much turn for the spinners and seamers won't be excited.

Amazing way to start. Nothing better than starting with a win at home. [Chat when Axar, Kuldeep were bowling] Those two are world-class bowlers and play a lot of cricket for India, thought we could take it deep with them being a bowler down. We were in a good position, and then to be with my great mate Liam, was pretty special. [Surviving the dropped chance] At that stage, you gotta take those risks, thankfully luck was on my side there. I knew after surviving it, one of us had to take it to the end Thought the wicket got better under lights, was a good pitch. Ground was big but the ball was travelling well, not much spin and ball was coming on nicely from the pacers. [Did you ask Dhawan for more overs] We got some great options, nice additions too, maybe it'll be different in Bangalore. Most importantly, we won.</p><p><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, Kings captain</strong>: Feels great, happy to be on the ground. I've been preparing for this tournament, this is the first time I'm playing at this high a level since the last IPL. I was a bit nervous as well but yeah, came through. No chat in the innings break after the 25-run over because I was preparing to bat. Also, bowlers will be going through their own emotions. So I would rather give them space and chat after things calm down. I felt we leaked a few extra runs, of course extra nerves are there in the first match. It's normal. Felt the wicket got better under lights, we got a good start and Sam played an amazing innings. Livingstone finished it nicely. [Decision to bowl first] I didn't know the records here, it's a new ground. So didn't focus on it too much, we practiced during day and at night. Thought we'd let the other team use their brains first and then we'll assess it. It worked for us, so we're happy and content.</p><p>Machakaari : ""DC didn't win the crucial moments. But for Kuldeep and Axar,Their bowling looks seriously weak. Fielding below par to say the least"" I still can't get over Warner dropping a catch.</p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant, DC captain</strong>: Ishant's injury was clearly evident because we were anyway one player short because we lagged with the batting a bit. Abhishek came in and chipped in with a few runs which were crucial. We were short on extra bowling. We actually pulled it back in the end [but couldn't complete the job], part and parcel of the game. [Batting] Personally I was pretty nervous but you have to go through this when you enter the field. This isn't the first time being nervous, but happy about that [return overall]. I think we had a par score but because we were one bowler short, because of an injury, can't do much about it. Wicket played as we expected to play, can't make excuses. We will learn from it but having one bowler short is never good. End of the day, well played to them [Kings] I guess. Porel's finish helped us finish on a high. It was an amazing innings, congrats to him. I think it's just his third or fourth game but the kind of impact he made was huge. Really looking forward [to seeing him] this season.</p><p><strong>7:19pm</strong> It was a seesaw battle but Kings were often in front. For Capitals, Ishant twisting an ankle in the field was a big blow. Especially since it was in the sixth over. The bowlers, Marsh and Khaleel in particular, not coming good cost them. Curran, pushed up to No. 4, was spectacular. Bairstow and Dhawan gave Kings a decent start but fell quickly, so Curran held the innings together amid Kuldeep looking threatening as ever.

Dre Russ did what he does best. You do your planning, and you try to execute your plans. But he's a pretty tough guy to bowl to. Tough job in cricket to bowl to someone like him.

Before the last over began, Klaasen and Shahbaz had pumped 63 off the three overs just before that.

This time I have been a different role, with a slightly different combination. Sanga has given me suggestions... I have been playing IPL for ten years, so there's experience coming in. Good start, but let's see how it goes. It's all about understanding your strengths and weakness. I just react to the ball. That helps me maintain the shape. I think I should give the trophy to Sandeep Sharma. I wouldn't have been standing here [but for him]... I thought of calling him, but then thought it would be a bit too much! Everyone chipped in well. We just had to stick to our plans.""</p><p><strong>Time for the presentations</strong></p><p>""Looks like Ashwin gave a coach's talk"" --- He loves it, KumarS!</p><p><strong>R Ashwin</strong>: ""It was a wicket of two halves. When we batted first, it stuck in the pitch. Sometimes it is tough... After the eight-over mark, we felt the wicket was a good one. In our view, we were ten short. It was a good pitch; it tends to get better here. I went for 12 off the first ball I bowled! I bowl in different stages of the game. The body is ageing. Requires different mindset. I came from a Test series. I went for 15 in the first over - that was inside the powerplay. The moment that phase of the game is done, I try to shell it away. The next three overs of mine went for 20, and I got a wicket... Most importantly, [it is about] preparing for every single batter in the opposition. The game is built by perception. Sandeep has been an unsung hero. He stepped up for Prasidh last year. He is a character; it's about the fight they have. A bowler for a fight is way more valuable than a bowler with a skill. There are two bouncers to be used, and that's the only fillip the bowlers have got in this competition. Boulty's very aggressive up front, and so is Nandre.""</p><p><strong>KL Rahul</strong>, LSG captain: ""I don't think the target was a lot; it was just ten over-par. We bowled well in patches. Not making too much out of it. Just made a few mistakes. Mohsin was our powerplay bowler in the first season, but he wasn't fully fit last season. Good to see him back. Naveen has been crucial for us since he has come in. Powerplay is crucial for every team, and I don't think any team has cracked it yet. We'll made from the small mistakes we made. When we are three [down] for nothing, and we give ourselves a chance of chasing 194 speaks of our line-up... We need to find ways to win games of cricket. We'll try to build from here, and see where we can get stronger. Langer's brought a lot of calmness to the group. I stole his line when I said we need to find ways to win games of cricket. We enjoy having him around. All of us have watched him coach Australia to a T20 World Cup and an Ashes victory. When you get runs, you always feel good. But it's important for us to end up on the winning side. That gives more satisfaction. Missing a season was really painful.""</p><p><strong>7.23pm</strong> LSG needed another 49 from the last 24 balls, with Rahul and Pooran well set and ready to smash. That is when Sandeep Sharma struck, and pushed LSG back against the wall. His first over had gone for only five, and he started the death overs with Rahul's wicket. Rahul took his time to score 58, and eventually, it was too much to do for even Pooran, who was much brighter with 64* in 41 balls. RR seemed to have lost their way after they had LSG at 11 for 3 and then 60 for 4, but Sandeep, who finished with 1 for 22 in three overs, was spot on when required.

For the uninitiated, Hardik Pandya's career was launched by Mumbai Indians, following which he has gone on to earn a superstar status. Then, released by Mumbai Indians, he joined Gujarat Titans as their captain for the franchise's first year. He led them to the title in their maiden season and to the final again last year. Now he has returned to Mumbai Indians in an all-cash trade, and has replaced Rohit Sharma as their captain.</p><p>The last time Rohit Sharma played for Mumbai Indians as a non-captain, they had never won the IPL. Now they jointly hold the record for most title wins. How will Rohit fare this year, freed up from his responsibilities? How will Hardik go, leading the team where he started his career?</p><p>The focus will be on them, but also on Shubman Gill, who has his first season as captain? His franchise may only be two years old, but have gotten used to success already so expectations will be high. I am Abhimanyu Bose, and I'll be joined soon by Sreshth Shah as we bring you all the action from the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.</p>",

With the dew, how the spinners bowled, they made sure we stayed in the game. It was all about putting on the pressure [on the batters]. [Mohit] has been a revelation for us since he joined us last year and hopefully he can continue his form. We just wanted them to feel under pressure. The plan was to keep building the pressure and wait for them to make a mistake. [On their total] I thought 170 was a good score but we definitely left 10-15 runs out there. Even with them, they were scoring above par but with the old ball and the pitch being slow, it's difficult to hit.""</p><p>Player of the match, <b>Sai Sudharsan</b>: ""Even in the first innings it was a little bit difficult. Dew helped them go after the bowlers but I think we pulled off a great game today. I'm not taking it as pressure, I'm just taking it as an opportunity to express myself and help my team win. After a few balls I felt it's not that kind of a wicket where you go after the ball every over. So i felt building the game was more important. I was actually a bit shocked for getting the player of the match because there were many great contributions [from the bowlers]. [On bowling plans] Taking the pace off was the plan. Even I found it difficult.""</p><p><hr></p><p><b>Hardik Pandya</b>: ""Obviously we back ourselves to chase those 42 runs [in the last five overs] but it was one of those days where we see the score quite less in those last five overs, we lost a bit of momentum there. It feels good to be back because this is one stadium where you can enjoy and feel the atmosphere quite lively and obviously the crowd was full and they got a good game as well. [On Tilak turning down the single to David] I think Tilak felt that was a better idea at that point of time. I completely back him. Not an issue, 13 games to go.""</p><p>Debutant <b>Spencer Johnson</b>: ""Absolutely incredible [experience]. Full house here. To get the win is very special. [On the 19th over] I think to stay calm. I had Ash [Nehra] telling me you're going to win the game. To have the backing from him and everyone else, even after going for runs in my first over, it's pretty cool. For me what works well is bowling hard lengths and keeping calm and not panicking and sticking to doing what I do well. This is easily the biggest crowd I've played in front of. I've always wanted to play cricket in india and here I am. I hope we can keep winning. Shubman is unbelievable. He sat next to me on the bus trip. He was calming me. We talked through the game. As a young captain, he's unbelievable.""</p><p>Roopang : ""Difference between two team is Nehraji""</p><p>Rajesh: ""While everybody plays cricket, Nehra plays football.

There were unforced errors, teams not capitalising after getting close to taking home the advantage. Kohli's intent™️ chat won't be too loud given how he exploded at the start.

Hope that trend continues as the tournament progresses and that you follow it along with us, here on Cricinfo.</p><p>Harit Gautam: """"We had to pay the price for dropping Kohli"" hope the selectors don't have to repeat Dhawan's words after the World Cup ""</p><p>Kozhakks: ""Loved the post match presentation from Kohli! The camaraderie between Harsha and Kohli was evident in that. ""</p><p>[Dancing down and hitting over cover to pacers] I had to, bowlers know I play the cover drive pretty well. So they won't allow me to hit gaps. Guys like KG and Arshdeep, if they are hitting length, you have to create momentum, once you're closer to the ball you negate the bounce. You have to come up with a game plan and try to keep improving. <b>I know my name is often used to just promote the T20 game across the world these days but still got it I guess</b>. [Last two months] We were not in the country. We were at a place where people weren't recognizing us. Just to feel normal for two months was a surreal experience. Of course, things become totally different with two kids from a family perspective. Just being together, the connection with the older kid too is amazing. I couldn't have been more grateful to God for the opportunity that I got to spend time with the family. I was telling the guys that the voices got that much louder as it wasn't the case for the last two months. It was amazing to be another person on the road. I don't play for caps, it's just another opportunity. (2/2)</p><p><strong>Virat Kohli, POTM</strong>: [To the crowd] Don't get overexcited, it's just two games. I know what this (orange cap) means. [Love story with the crowd] It's been going on for years. People talk a lot about playing the sport. At the end of the day you don't talk about the achievements, stats or numbers but the memories. It's what Rahul Dravid says. The friendship, love, appreciation, backing has been amazing and is what you'll miss and never forget. In T20, I'm opening, I try to give the team a blazing start. But when wickets start falling, you have to understand the conditions as well. The wicket wasn't as placid as normal here. It was a bit two-paced. Had to play correct cricketing shots, couldn't hit balls across the line. Tried a few, felt like I needed big hits at the other end, which didn't happen as Maxi and Anuj got out quickly. Disappointed not having finished it off. It was a slot ball that I sliced straight to deep point. Not a bad bad though playing after two months and getting into the tournament. (1/2)</p><p><strong>Faf du Plessis, RCB captain</strong>: [Was he cool] Only on the outside, not as much on the inside. Gotta make sure you get over the line early in the tournament. Great to see the composure at the end. Don't think game was gone after Kohli went, because of the Impact Player and Mahipal in. In previous years we used to feel 12 runs in the last overs would be tough but now even 15s seem gettable in the last two. Really pleased for DK getting his game going. It sets us up for the rest of the tournament. Games get won at lost at the No. 7 and 8 position with the Impact subs, so he's key. Our plan at the auction was to find the DNA of the team. It's tough on this unique ground. The pitch was a bit different. Kohli's is still the same person, has had a nice break. It helps keep fresh in the back end of the career.</p><p><strong>Dinesh Karthik</strong> Getting there [past the rust] I wasn't completely in control but it started to feel good. We needed the partnership with Lomror, he took the pressure off me with that six. It was critical, he batted well. Harshal is a wily customer. If you miss the dipping slower ball, you're done, so I had to time the scoop well. Lomror looked calm, didn't tell him anything at first. Told him to put that behind after he hit that six, then keep his head still and the rest will follow through. He's been batting well in the nets too.</p><p><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, Punjab Kings captain</strong>: Good game, we brought it back. Think we were 10-15 less. Should have encashed in the first six overs. We had to pay the price for dropping Kohli. We lost momentum there, it was crucial. It looked a good wicket but wasn't true. It was stopping, bit of double-bounce and turned. 70% it was coming good. I was happy with my runs but think could've played faster in the first six. We lost two wickets which put pressure too. That total we thought was par. Match went till last over, at the end we could have bowled better. Harpreet is bowling really well, that too to left-handers on a small ground.  He soaked in pressure and got breakthroughs. His celebration, the Kabaddi thing, is big in Punjab. People connect with the thigh-five, happy to see him doing it</p><p><strong>11:14pm</strong> It was a twist-y turn-y chase. Kings were in it despite the unforced error. But Kohli gave RCB liftoff and DK landed the plane safely. All games this season have been won by the home team. RCB's record hasn't been great but that wasn't an issue tonight. The biggest event seemed to have taken place at the start of the chase, when Bairstow dropped Kohli. It unleashed one of the best players, and indeed flayers, in cricket. Him charging pacers and clubbing them through extra is what we've imagined doing as kids. The overseas stars failed. Promoting Green to No. 3 and Patidar over Maxwell didn't work. Harpreet was sensational, Rabada was good too. The constant wickets almost derailed the chase, especially Kohli fell due to some smart field placement. But DK came in with ice in the veins, got Lomror for support and the duo cleared the game with great skill and calmness.</p><p>Raab: ""As a Bangladeshi, just had PTSD watching DK bat like this. If you know, you know. ""</p>"

<p><strong>7.29pm</strong> All set then. Out come the two umpires, followed by the two CSK openers, Rachin Ravindra and Ruturaj Gaikwad. The GT team stride out too, led by Shubman Gill. Gaikwad will take strike. Azmatullah Omarzai to take the new ball. He got some swing in the first game. He is over the wicket with one slip in place.</p><p>Amarnath: ""What if they bring in Theekshana or Santner instead of Pathirana in the 2nd innings..Just to take the opposition off guard."" Santner.

Santner might still come in as a sub, though Gaikwad said that Pathirana will be included. Titans have a balanced side, and will bank on their batters to chase down anything. Will we see Rachin Ravindra getting a bowl here? And on the subject of Rachin, here's Deiva about an <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2024-rachin-ravindra-s-unlikely-wellington-reunion-in-chennai-1426324"">unlikely Wellington reunion</a> in Chennai.  </p><p>Elsewhere, India chase their FIFA World Cup dream in a qualification match against Afghanistan in what happens to be Sunil Chhetri's 150th match.

(CSK fanbase) Its amazing. Coming from a little country at the bottom of the earth, this is really special. (Gujarat Titans' challenge) They've been at the pointy end of the last two tournaments, they know how to win. For us it is to control what we can, do the little things well. (New captain) He's obviously a good man. He's a world-class batter at the top of the order. He is cool and calm like MS. (Chennai conditions, typical?) The characteristics of the pitch are similar to what we've seen at CSK.</p><p>Aditya: ""Woah! The new generation of captaincy coming into effect!

Titans are going in unchanged, but CSK have one change. They have <strong>Pathirana coming in for Theekshana</strong>.</p><p><strong>Gill:</strong> That [first] match was very physically and mentally exhausting. Quick turnaround, but we are are used to it. It was a tremendous feeling to be able to be down in the game and then come back. It showed the character of our team. We are going with the same team.</p><p>Huge applause for <strong>Gaikwad</strong>: We were looking to bowl first. Wicket is similar to what we had in the first game. Batting first here is not much difference. I would say, slightly rusty start but we came back well. And once we came back we did not allow them to be back. Everyone showed good intent. In place of Theeskahana, we have our Malinga, Pathirana.</p><p><strong>Pitch report from Anjum Chopra and Mathew Hayden</strong>: Lovely to be back. Really good wicket. There was quite a lot of bounce in the first game. There is a lot of grass on the surface. Very unusual for Chepauk to have grass. The way Chahar bowled in the first game, it was carrying really nicely through. There are patches where it is a little uneven with the grass surface. Very much inside the first four or five overs to do the damage and then the spin comes into its own and it gets tough. That is where CSK come to their own. It is a bat first wicket. </p><p><b>6.55pm</b> Another interesting subplot in this game is the Chennai boys vs Chennai Super Kings. Titans have as many as five Tamil Nadu players in their side - Sai Sudharsan, Sai Kishore, Vijay Shankar, Shahrukh Khan and Sandeep Warrier. Among the quintet, Sudharsan, Kishore and Vijay are set to slot into Titans' XI or XII (accounting for the Impact Player). Sudharsan, Kishore and Vijay all have been part of CSK or Junior Super Kings, their grassroots programme. And back in the day, Shahrukh used to be a ball boy at Chepauk for IPL matches. In contrast, CSK don't have a single local player in their main squad.</p>

<p>CricDude: ""GT needs to relook at their middle order. Except Tewatia, all others take time to settle. They need to bring in Abhinav Manohar who can keep the run rate up.""</p><p><strong>6.50pm</strong> New captains Gill and Gaikwad have already grabbed the headlines with their captaincy. After Titans snatched victory from Mumbai debutant Spencer Johnson talked up Gill's leadership, saying the captain sat alongside him on the bus to help calm his nerves in the lead-up to the game. As for Gaikwad, he rifled through fielding changes in his first game as IPL captain, and one such change, which involved extra-cover moving to sweeper cover, brought CSK their first wicket. The two new captains will once again be in the spotlight. <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/chennai-super-kings-vs-gujarat-titans-7th-match-1422125/match-preview"">Here's Deivarayan Muthu with the preview. </a></p><p>Joy: ""If Pathirana is good to go, I would bring him in for Theekshana.

It was the <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/gujarat-titans-vs-chennai-super-kings-final-1370353/full-scorecard"">final of IPL 2023</a> which began on a Sunday and ended on a Tuesday. In between there was a clash which ebbed and flowed like you won't believe. And in the end, with CSK requiring 10 off 2, Ravindra Jadeja struck a six and a four to help CSK secure a fifth IPL final. If the two teams can recreate even half of the drama from that game, we're in for some fun.</p>

<p><B>Ravindra:</b> Pretty good wicket to bat on. Skidded on nicely. (This innings) Like I said before, more about showing intent. Rutu is good to bat with, has a calm head. Wickets in India feel pretty quick so you can react to it. (Comparison of batting with Conway) I think as a player you always want to take down the powerplay. I got balls I could take on. It is slightly different from how Dev bats, if I can do half of what he does, I'll be in a good spot. (Target) I think its a bit over par. There will be a slight bit of dew. We need to stay in the game.</p><p>Ramith : ""Shoutout to your prediction algorithm… amazing work!!!""</p><p>Pradeep : ""This CSK lineup looks too good to miss playoffs. Contributions from each player, is what many teams are missing in IPL""</p><p><b>9.21pm</b>: Right, so CSK finish on 206 for 6. It's not a normal Chepauk surface, absolute belter today. But you have to think that CSK are above par. The impetus was provided by Rachin, who came out all guns blazing smashing a 20-ball 46, hacking six fours and three sixes. Once he fell, it was Gaikwad and Rahane who took the innings forward before Shivam Dube took over. He hammered two fours and five sixes, taking down Sai Kishore and Rashid. Sameer Rizvi, in his first IPL stint, then crashed Rashid for a six first ball to take CSK past 200. Can Titans chase this down? Join Sreshth in a bit to find out.</p>"

Last year he had a fantastic strike rate. But before that season his strike rate in T20s was 127. So he has always been a guy who takes his time, thinks about batting long. So I don't think that's the case with him. Ruturaj Gaikwad is the kind of player who looks for a big strike rate, score quick runs. Today, Rachin was taking an aggressive approach.

<p><strong>7:29pm</strong> Nanda Kishore and Nitin Menon are the umpires walking out. Capitals' players follow them. Jaiswal and Buttler to open for RR of course. Khaleel has the ball.

But the point holds</p><p>Hari: ""Even with impact player, RR only has 6 batters? they badly need a batting allrounder for worst case situations..."" It was a concern last year but they're happy to adapt based on how things are going in the first innings, like in the last game.</p><p>Vivaan: ""@Ekanth Fraser McGurk cannot be subbed in because DC area already starting with 4 overseas players :p"" Oh yeah, sorry.

Simon Katich says RR have done their homework after a poor home showing last season. Pitch 5 was used twice, they made 237 and got bundled for 60. They'll hope to change that trend. It's a rock-hard pitch. When the cracks are pressed, there is a bit of movement which indicates there could be low bounce with the new ball, which was the case in the first game too. Going into the pitch with cutters, going high with the bouncers - something Sandeep did well - is expected to work. Both teams have had issues chasing.

<p>Mustafa Moudi: ""Its really strange that DC didnt pick Prithvi Shaw in their opening match. Yes, he has a terrible season last year but that doesnt make him a Poor Batsman.

The trends at the 17th edition of the IPL have been strong and Rajasthan Royals will hope to continue it against Delhi Capitals. Rishabh Pant's comeback last week was amazing, more for his return than his performance. His keeping was solid and his range-hitting - including some competition with Jake Fraser-McGurk in the lead-up to this game, has been good. Ishant Sharma, who got injured while fielding last game, is available. Anrich Nortje is expected to play, Prithvi Shaw might be out. Capitals need their middle order to fire.</p>",

For someone coming in, it's not easy but not as much for someone set. It's been tough, I am a bit emotional right now. But it's been a lot of work. Backed myself, practiced a lot, seeing the fruits of it now.</p><p><strong>9:24pm</strong> 58 off Parag's last 19 balls, says Simon Katich. It was ridiculous hitting. Whether the bowling was on point or not, it was sensational. You don't just hit both sides of the wicket with that good a connection repeatedly. There were things that happened before but who cares? I mean, if living in the moment was this fun, self-help people wouldn't have had to use it so much. Anyway, it's a great score. Parag started well, carried the innings together. Ashwin played a handy cameo. Capitals' new-ball bowlers were great. Axar tried holding them down. Kuldeep was good but was taken down. I'm just typing words on autopilot.</p>"

The IPL is changing and we all have to be flexible. Earlier it was about 11 players, now it is about all 15 players. Me and Sanga had a lot of chat between 15th and 17th over before deciding the Impact Player. It's all about gauging in which zone they are. You have to look at that and take your decision. I saw Sandy was calm and Avesh was also looking good, so i went with that. Riyan Parag has been a big name in the last few years. Wherever I go, people ask me about him. There is something very special he can give to Indian cricket.""</p><p><b>Riyan Parag</b>, Player of the Match: ""Emotions are settled, mum's here as well. She's seen the struggles, this feels special. I know what my ability is and I never let that change - irrespective of whether I perform or not. A lot to do with the domestic season, where I scored a lot of runs. Someone in the top four has to take it deep. First match, Sanju bhaiya did it, today I did it. I had to work very hard. I was on bed in the last three days. I could manage it today.""</p><p><b>11:25pm</b> High fives all around in the Royals camp. Ninth successive win by a home team this season. The bowling changes from Samson were spot on. Never let the batters settle and some excellent death bowling saw them eke out a 12-run win. This was after a Riyan Parag special enthralled one and all in Jaipur. That was clean-hitting of a different class, capitalising on his superb form. Axar was thrifty with the ball for Capitals, but barring Warner, none of the batters could get going.</p><p><b>Rishabh Pant</b>, Capitals captain: ""Definitely disappointed. The best thing to do from here to learn from it. The bowlers did well through the 15-16 overs. But the batters did well at the death, hopefully we do better in the next game. The platform that Warner-Marsh gave was very nice. We had to save wickets. We had to consolidate but at the end we had a lot to cover up. [On not bowling Nortje to Parag earlier] There is always one or the other option, but we wanted to finish Nortje in the death overs. Sometimes you are going to go for runs. Didn't go well for us today.""</p><p><b>Avesh Khan</b>, Royals bowler: ""[On the death-over yorkers] My plan is always clear. One side was longer, so my plan was to bowl wide yorkers. I was giving myself five seconds and only thought about executing them. My focus is always on the execution and back my yorkers. Enjoying myself here because we have Sandeep, Boult, Burger, all of whom have different skills. Samson gives me freedom to execute and only steps in if he sees I am struggling. I try to improve myself everytime. In T20s I try to reinvent myself. I never think about selection and only practice what I want to bowl.""</p>"

<p><strong>6:40pm</strong> Andre Russell has announced himself in quite the style this season. His unbeaten 64 off just 25 balls - <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/vintage-andre-russell-comes-calling-in-kkr-ipl-2024-opener-at-eden-gardens-1426035"">vintage stuff from Dre Russ</a> - massively helped KKR to edge out Sunrisers in their opening contest. Not to mention his two wickets with the ball. What's very impressive is the work that went behind in him finding his mojo back, especially against spin. He has worked a lot on hitting spin with some help from his KKR team-mate Sunil Narine. Hemant Brar has more on how <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/how-andre-russell-switched-on-beast-mode-once-again-1426857"">a small stride helped Russell take a giant leap</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is a landmark game for Narine as well.

A warm welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of perhaps one of the spicy contests in the IPL - Royal Challengers Bengaluru feat. Virat Kohli versus Kolkata Knight Riders with Gautam Gambhir as mentor. Home teams have won all nine contests in IPL 2024 so far, and both RCB and KKR are coming here off wins. RCB already have a loss to their name though, will KKR also follow suit?

<p><b>9:04pm</b> Kohli stays unbeaten after opening the batting - the 16th time it has happened in the IPL - to finish on 83, but have RCB have got enough? He started off in top gear but even as he continued to motor along, the others around him struggled. Only Green and Maxwell managed to find the boundaries regularly, and then of course, Karthik at the end. But has Kohli's innings put RCB in a good position or are KKR in it?</p><p><b>Cameron Green</b> after handing Kohli the Orange Cap: ""Pretty happy with the total. Bit more freedom in the last couple of innings. Good to get in early today. There's certain bowlers in their team I haven't faced before but [Kohli] has, so that helped. They used the change of pace, hitting it in the wicket. Hopefully dew does not come in.""</p><p>KKR will fancy their chances with a long batting line-up. Will they break the home-team winning streak? Join Sreshth to find out</p><p>Sudhir: ""Honest opinion (and I know I'm right) - RCB missed a key play by not sending in D Karthik earlier, ahead of Patidar and Rawat. They are 30-40 short of a part total, I think."" Might not be that big a difference, but yes, I think DK should have come in earlier given how little of the innings was left</p>"

Communication was brilliant. (Narine as opener) See Narine when he comes in, he has one job that is to clear the outfield and get maximum runs. Today was a phenomenal example. We were contemplating today whether to open with him or not, but this was great. (Nature of surface between innings) From one end, it was pretty good to bat on. From the other end, it was two-paced. It was bouncing extra. That was the communication we were having and passing it on to the batter coming next. (Break between now and next game in Visakhapatnam) We are spending a day here tomorrow and then going to Vizag. Have to see the nature of the pitch there.

Also my fiance was here today so it was a special day. (Facing Vyshak) Pace-off in totality was tough but if fast bowlers bowled pace-on, it was easy to take them to the cleaners. Happened with us in our bowling innings too.""</p><p>Bruce Wayne: ""Any one who played more than 6 deliveries in this match had a higher SR than Kohli - and that is the reason RCB lost - not ground or dimensions or pitch.

It was not easy batting in the first innings, and you could see that with Virat also struggling a little. (Looking back) We could've tried one or two things, but the way Salt-Narine batted, they pretty much took the game away. They were excellent and broke the game in the first six overs. (Did you miss spin options?) We've tried Maxwell and fingerspinners are effective here but today there wasn't much spin. And with them having a left-right combination, spinners can find it tricky. We needed a wristspinner who could turn it both ways. (Vyshak) Very good. He hasn't had a lot of opportunity. We thought of getting legspinner Karn as an Impact Sub but brought him in for his cutters. We saw Dre Russ bowled 80% of his balls as cutters, so knew that would work. Good mix-ups from Vyshak, in terms of skillset.</p>

<p><B>10.45pm</b> And an away team finally wins a game in IPL 2024. This game turned out to be a non-contest with KKR cruising to victory with 3.1 overs remaining. Every batter who turned up in purple and gold had a field day out today on a batting-friendly surface, and this par target was razed down easily.<BR><BR>KKR fans would once again love to see Narine get among the runs, who nearly got a fifty in his 500th T20 appearance. Salt, the two Iyers and an unbeaten Rinku ensured all their boxes were ticked as a batting side.<BR><BR>For RCB, only Vyshak's spell was promising. Otherwise, they all went for runs, even the spearheads Siraj and Alzarri Joseph. The only question that remains is whether they lost the match with the ball or with the bat when they scored only 182. We'll know more about what they think when we hear from Faf du Plessis.</p>"

In IPL 2023, he was a net bowler for Chennai Super Kings and in the past, he has also had a stint with India as a net bowler.

<p><strong>Mayank Yadav, POTM</strong> I've always heard from others there's nervousness in debuts but that goes away after the first ball. Plan was to not be under too much pressure and to bowl at the stumps and use the pace as much as possible. There was the thought to mix up the pace initially but the wicket helped and the skipper told me to bowl gas. The debut wicket was the favourite. Coming off the injury last season was tough, I'd set my goal to debut at a young age but injuries were a setback.</p><p><strong>Nicholas Pooran, LSG captain</strong>: Wonderful start in front a home crowd. (On the batting order) We had a start at the chat of the tournament. Use the left-right combo as needed. It's a big ground, one side big. It's tough as you have to go big while going at tens. Shikhar and YJB played well, but they didn't take the game away from us. Mayank's was the story of the night. It was an inspiring performance. Every person in the team is happy he got a chance and performed tonight. Was wonderful watching him from mid-off. It's a young bowling attack. The IPL has given local players opportunities to grow. We have youngsters, experienced players and coaching staff as well. Expect guys to get better. Groundsmen, everyone who contributed was amazing.</p><p>Jasdev: ""Glad any LSG batsman didn't score big. Now the MoM can deservedly go to Mayank Yadav !!""</p><p>Farid: ""So Delhi and Mumbai are the only winless teams after two rounds of matches.""</p><p><strong>Morne Morkel, LSG bowling coach</strong>: Happy with the win. Bowlers stuck to it. In the first timeout told the bowlers to stay in the game. Then young Mayank bowled serious heat and got the wickets. It was tough last year as he got injured after the first warm-up game. We're managing him better. He ran in and that was the pleasing thing. We asked the guys to do the basics well on a good wicket. Told him to stick to his lengths and use bouncers. Proud he ran in and bowled gas despite the humidity. How the wicket would play was an unknown, we had to sum up conditions and use them. We had five-six days after the first game, that could've worked against us too. It's harder sitting in the dugout than on comms. (<i>laughs</I>)</p><p><strong>Shikhar Dhawan</strong> They played well, Livi got injured that impacted us. He'd have come in at 4. Mayank bowled really well. His pace outsmarted us. It was nice facing him, surprised me with that pace. Knew as an experienced player I'd use it. But he figured it out and bowled yorkers to keep me down to a dot and a single. I was mindful and told my partners to use the short side. He bowled at Prabh's body and got him out. Told Jitesh to leave Mayank and take on the other bowlers but they bowled well too and then used the pressure against us. We're gonna analyse the game. We gotta take catches, that takes the momentum away and gets the energy down. To come up with better plans and more importantly implement them is what we need to do. We're close but need to do 10% more.</p><p><strong>11:20pm</strong> It's another home-team win on Mayank Yadav day. It was an innings of two halves. Bairstow and Dhawan owned the first and Mayank the next. It was singlehanded and shows that the beauty of pace extends beyond optics if accurate. <strong>Just for reference, Kings needed 102 off 60 with ten wickets in hand. By the time Mayank was done, they needed 60 off 24 with seven wickets in hand.</strong> It was oh so effective, he's all smiles while hugging his opponents. Doubt he'll be tired of the compliments. His fellow debutant, Siddharth, started well bowling like Akeal Hosein in the first over of the innings but was found out. The duo stayed deep in the crease, literally, and found the boundaries often. They nailed the chase for a while but Mayank's entry hurried batters, created dots. It led to Bairstow falling. The new guys tried working against it, unlike Dhawan and also fell. Mohsin was excellent on the other end too. It slowed Shikhar before dismissing him. Krunal bowled tight enough for the game to not drift. Naveen got some tap in the end but had more than enough to defend.</p>"

<p>Unsurprisingly, no changes to the SRH opening combination. Travis Head is back at Motera for the first time since the greatest cricketing night of his life. He'll partner Mayank Agarwal. No change to the GT plan for now either. Azmatullah Omarzai will get first use of the new ball. Mayank will take strike. </p><p>Aashique : ""I think GT have one of the best squad but they are not being able to figure out best 12."" --- One feature of Nehra's GT has been their brave calls coming off, like Vijay Shankar in the middle order last season.

It's an absolute road, says Kevin Pietersen, who thinks it looks like a tremendous wicket. He says there's a breeze which will help the players as temperatures are expected to reach 38-40 degrees celsius. Sunrisers will come here, look at that wicket, and say maybe they can make 270 again, chuckles Pietersen, as he tells Ravi Shastri they are going to be calling sixes and fours galore. It's a black soil wicket, adds Shastri, so that is similar to the November 19, 2023. That wasn't as high-scoring, so a nice bit of intrigue surrounds that. . </p><p>Ashish: ""Is robin minz available for selection?""  <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/tanush-kotian-and-br-sharath-replace-adam-zampa-and-robin-minz-for-ipl-2024-1425730"">BR Sharath has replaced him</a>. I didn't know but Aaditya was onto it in a flash. Here he is for more insights.</p>

<p><strong>2:40pm</strong> As for Sunrisers, they're 1-1 but were four runs away from making it 2-0. Their pacers need some oomph. Cummins was excellent during MI's 278-run chase but still isn't a T20 whiz. Very different from Tests. His inclusion comes at a cost of other players - like Glenn Phillips and Marco Jansen - missing out. Wanindu Hasaranga's still not in India but he's not too far from making it either. But Cummins is cricketing chess grandmaster and alpha at the same time. He, along with Travis Head, has what it takes to silence the crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Their batting's crazy strong with <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/heinrich-klaasen-s-big-hitting-transformation-1426919"">six-machine Klaasen</a> and in-form Abhishek Sharma.</p><p>Aditya: ""Hey there Ekanth!

<p>Unsurprisingly, no changes to the SRH opening combination. Travis Head is back at Motera for the first time since the greatest cricketing night of his life. He'll partner Mayank Agarwal. No change to the GT plan for now either. Azmatullah Omarzai will get first use of the new ball. Mayank will take strike. </p><p>Aashique : ""I think GT have one of the best squad but they are not being able to figure out best 12."" --- One feature of Nehra's GT has been their brave calls coming off, like Vijay Shankar in the middle order last season. They certainly haven't yet put a finger no their balance without Hardik Pandya, though. </p><p>I've got plenty of you asking me about Natarajan's fitness status. He missed the last game with an unspecified niggle, so we're assuming him missing out today is only a continuation of that. </p><p>Abhishek Shah: ""GT make changes in bowling and not batting?? Baffling.. "" --- That's one way to describe it. Sai Kishore certainly will consider himself unlucky to miss out. </p><p><strong>Pat Cummins has won the toss, and SRH will bat first. </strong>He says it's a good wicket and it's pretty hot, so they want to put some runs on the board. Got some wonderful memories at this stadium, he says. He says the last game was a measure of how good they are. <strong>No changes for SRH. </strong></p><p>Gill says they would've bowled first, with the thinking being that they would like to know what the target is in front of them. <strong>Noor Ahmad and Darshan Nalkande come into the Gujarat side today, Spencer Johnson and Sai Kishore make way</strong> </p><p>Playing XIs: </p><p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad: </strong>1.

It's an absolute road, says Kevin Pietersen, who thinks it looks like a tremendous wicket. He says there's a breeze which will help the players as temperatures are expected to reach 38-40 degrees celsius. Sunrisers will come here, look at that wicket, and say maybe they can make 270 again, chuckles Pietersen, as he tells Ravi Shastri they are going to be calling sixes and fours galore. It's a black soil wicket, adds Shastri, so that is similar to the November 19, 2023. That wasn't as high-scoring, so a nice bit of intrigue surrounds that. . </p><p>Ashish: ""Is robin minz available for selection?""  <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/tanush-kotian-and-br-sharath-replace-adam-zampa-and-robin-minz-for-ipl-2024-1425730"">BR Sharath has replaced him</a>. I didn't know but Aaditya was onto it in a flash. Here he is for more insights.</p>

<p><strong>2:40pm</strong> As for Sunrisers, they're 1-1 but were four runs away from making it 2-0. Their pacers need some oomph. Cummins was excellent during MI's 278-run chase but still isn't a T20 whiz. Very different from Tests. His inclusion comes at a cost of other players - like Glenn Phillips and Marco Jansen - missing out. Wanindu Hasaranga's still not in India but he's not too far from making it either. But Cummins is cricketing chess grandmaster and alpha at the same time. He, along with Travis Head, has what it takes to silence the crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Their batting's crazy strong with <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/heinrich-klaasen-s-big-hitting-transformation-1426919"">six-machine Klaasen</a> and in-form Abhishek Sharma.</p><p>Aditya: ""Hey there Ekanth!

<p><b>5:08pm</b>: SRH were 58/1 at the end of the powerplay, with Travis Head going great guns. But he fell trying to attack Noor, then Mohit picked up Abhishek just when he looked set to go big, then Rashid removed the dangerous Klaasen. The Titans were very effective taking the pace off the ball towards the back end of that innings. Have SRH learned from that? Their captain specialises in that kind of bowling in white ball cricket, to be fair, so he'll certainly be encouraged by what he's seen from the wicket. They've got the extra spin option into their side, in the form of Washington, can he make use of the spin available on this track? 162 is not a huge total, but certainly is defendable.</p><p><b>Abdul Samad</b>: This is a decent score. It's a day game, there's some help for the spinners as well, so this is a decent score. I was striking the ball well, so I thought I should've got more strike in the last over. Looking at our start, we thought we could get around 180, but around 160 is a decent score as well.</p>"

<p>That's the 11th win for the home team in 12 games. Will that trend continue in Delhi or can super-strong CSK change that? <a href=""http://""https://espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/delhi-capitals-vs-chennai-super-kings-13th-match-1422131/live-cricket-score>Find out Live here</a>. Thanks for tuning in to this match. I'm Ekanth, signing off on behalf of my co-commentator Aaditya Narayan, and our scorers, Thilak Rama and M Venkat Raghav.</p><p><strong>Mohit Sharma, POTM</strong>: Thanks for telling me I'm aging. I practice what I do generally. What's important is knowing when to use them and being ahead of the batter. Everyone has them on slow wickets but knowing how to use it against whom is key. (Importance of tweaking the field when bowling slow) If you and the batter knows what you'll deliver, then you need to play with one fielder's position to deceive the batter. If he's ready for a slower bouncer but I go slow and wide, he won't be ready. (Bowling slow balls in night games) We practice with a wet ball to contend with dew. But it's an uncontrollable, mindset matters more there. (On his role) As long as I do well I enjoy. When you don't it hurts a bit but you have to go back and review things after the game. But it's better if the mistakes are due to failing in execution rather than not following the plan. Spinners were excellent after SRH started well. It helped us chase a smaller target.</p><p><strong>Shubman Gill, GT captain</strong>: Winning two matches at home is great, two more to go and then we go on the road. Hope to bring the momentum back. Our bowlers, esp Noor, Rashid bhai is world-class. But Noor and Darshan bowled excellently. Mohit is such an experienced bowler, esp on wickets like this. Not easy to bowl three or four overs back to back. He mixes up yorkers, slower ones so well. In this heat, it's easier to bat early in day games. So we wanted to make them hit to the bigger boundary off slower balls. Ball hit the bottom of my bat on my wicket ball. In T20s if you see the ball in your slot you have to go for it. We thought 160-170 would be a good score. Credit to the bowlers to restrict them. Everyone knows their roles in terms of batting or bowling. Sai has played well, Wriddhi bhai does what he does well. Miller's gotten in form too. He has just a cramp I think.</p><p>Shadow-Shell: ""Wow! Highest impact is Mohit with 58.38. Shows how no one dominated the game more than other""</p><p>Ananthanarayana: ""Men in blue beat pat Cummins led side in Ahmedabad ! ""</p><p><strong>Sai Sudharsan</strong>: Happy with my contribution as it helped the team to win. On this wicket it was tough to play pacers bowling slower ones. So we thought of targeting spinners and maximising there. Great contribution from Mohit and Rashid, they saved 10-15 runs which was key. To be playing in front of home crowd is a plus point which is playing in our favour. [Being out in the 40s] Everyone wants to score more every game, I'm just thinking of contributing and helping the team win. Milestones will come.</p><p><strong>Pat Cummins, SRH captain</strong>: Good match but we got 10-15 less. They bowled well. Losing a couple of wickets meant we couldn't get a batter not making fifty plus. It happens, it was probably the difference. [Him coming in late to bowl] Today it was a case because we thought the wicket would slow up a little bit and offcutters would become more effective, which they were. [Would he have changed the toss decision] No, I thought the wicket played the same in both innings. It's T20 cricket, batters have had fantastic couple of games. The boys looked good but were stifled by the wickets.</p><p><strong>6:54pm</strong> It was a clean finish. Titans took it deep, had wickets in hand and the experienced Miller took them over the line. SRH were probably unders after being stifled in the powerplay. Four batters made 20s and three between 15 and 20. In contrast, all four of Titans' top order got more than 25. Saha attacked Shahbaz, got boundaries off Unadkat and Bhuvi too. Gill carried on with Sai Sudharsan with the asking rate not mounting. SRH were trying to get a good chunk of their spinners' overs out but it led to only two wickets in the first ten. Gill's wicket didn't open up the game as Miller joined Sudharsan. Cummins' entry slowed the rate, Miller was hobbling at times but the 24-run 16th over off Markande meant there were no death-overs worries. Vijay Shankar too chipped in with a cameo in the end.</p><p>nickH: ""GT's 20th over and SRH's 16th over decided the game.""</p>"

Even around the threates, which are screening the brand-new Telugu movie <i>Tillu Square</i>.

Says he was wanted to bowl. Good toss to lose, we'll see what we can put up. (Mumbai's 250th game) This franchise holds a lot of value and a lot of love from the fans (boos go up again but he keeps loud and firm), exciting to be very honest. (It gets quieter again) We are quite lucky to be part of the 250th game. Slow start doesn't bother us. We hope to have clarity, keep the mood happy and light. This group is all about that. Looking forward to play a brand of cricket everyone enjoys and gets that two points.</p><p><strong>Sanju Samson</strong>: Bowling first (gets a small cheer after that) says they are confident. This is the first game here, hope the seamers will use the conditions upfront. Confident from the wins but the tournament has not yet started so we need to keep going. Sandeep misses out, he's not 100% fit. Burger in the XI.</p><p><strong>7pm</strong> Sanjay Manjrekar is out for the toss with Hardik Pandya and Sanju Samson. Sanjay asks for a big round of applause for Hardik but there is a boo. ""Behave,"" he says. <strong>RR have won the toss and will bowl</strong>. Small cheer from the crowd</p><p><strong>Pitch report</strong>: Pitch No. 7 being used. Not used in IPL 2023. Brian Lara says the red-soil surface looks great. It has a generous covering of grass and the team that's bowling first has to get new-ball wickets. We're gonna see a lot of runs. Not sure spinners are gonna come into the game because of the grass. What the team does on winning the toss will be crucial - RR have won batting first. MI have chased, they came short (although they made 246 in 278-run chase). The team batting first will have the advantage.</p><p>Sujatha : ""Looking Hardik as a villain is totally uncalled for. It is sport , professional sport , a Franchise driven league.

Sandeep Sharma has been amaze at the death, Avesh Khan can offer him support. Nandre Burger can chomp into top orders with the new ball. R Ashwin and Yuzi Chahal are skilful spinners but won't have helpful conditions. That's a challenge, as is Jos Buttler's poor form. But he'll have a local batter in Yashasvi Jaiswal familiar with the conditions. Their middle order was taken down in the last game but Ashwin came in and gave them an escape. They'll look to bounce back in that department.</p><p>Abhi: ""@Ekanth, Rajath didn't mean that when he said toss!"" Ah, if it's the Pandya reception, yeah, that too, as highlighted in the opening para.</p><p>Rajath : ""I think i am not the only one who is more excited for toss more than the match."" A belter is expected and these two teams have a pattern, so the toss could be crucial.</p><p>Mustafa Moudi : ""With DC's win last match, Mumbai Indians remains the only winless side now.

But even a return to their home ground could not help Mumbai Indians avoid defeat for the third consecutive game. There were some boos for Hardik, several cheers for Rohit, but it was the Royals bowlers who stole the show. Trent Boult was sublime with the new ball, with two wickets in the first over. Mumbai lost three players for golden ducks thanks to the left-arm quick. Nandre Burger was also great with the new ball as Royals dominated the powerplay. Chahal helped take out the middle order and that left Royals chasing 126. Maphaka started with Jaiswal's wicket in the first over and Bumrah bowled a probing spell without luck, but Akash Madhwal's two strikes just around the end of the powerplay gave Mumbai Indians a sniff at an upset. But with Ashwin pushed up the order to arrest a potential collapse, Parag continued to impress as he played a calm, nerveless knock to eventually make sure Royals won without much fuss. Akash Madhwal's performance will be a rare positive for Mumbai Indians, but they know they have a lot of work to do. For Royals, they would want Buttler and Jaiswal - their gun openers - to start firing soon. While those teams ponder about what's next for them, we are going to wind down here.

Thank you for joining us. On behalf of Ekanth, Chandan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo, this is Abhimanyu signing off. Goodnight!</p><p><b>11.12pm</b> Time for the presentation ceremony, then.</p><p>The player of the match is, as expected, <b>Trent Boult:</b> ""[First over wickets] Never say it's a certainty in the format, but it was nice to get the wickets. We created early pressure, nice to take some wickets and glad the result went our way. [On the Rohit wicket] I've played against Rohit a lot over the years and it was just about trying to do something different. It rarely comes off, you try something different and it works, but great when it does. [On Burger] He has been a great find. Bowls with great skill and plays with his heart on his sleeves. Sandeep obviously missed out but he'll play a big role in the season. Excited to be part of this bowling attack.""</p><p>Rajasthan Royals captain, <b>Sanju Samson:</b> ""[The toss] I think that was the gamechanger. The toss was very crucial. I felt it was too sticky to start off and we had the experience of Trent Boult and Nandre Burger's speed. [Boult] has been playing international cricket for so long and we expected him to deliver. I didn't expect four or five wickets down, but it was great. We all do our roles and move on. Someone like R Ashwin knew we had a good powerplay so he didn't go for wickets, just kept it tight. So it's about teamwork.""</p><p><b>10.56pm</b> Riyan Parag's assured innings, along with handy contributions from R Ashwin and Shubham Dubey have helped Royals seal this chase with ease. A fired up early spell from Bumrah and Madhwal saw Royals lose three wickets early-ish, but  Parag marshalled the chase expertly. Of course, it was Trent Boult and Nandre Burger and the rest of their bowlers who set up the win.</p><p><b>Riyan Parag</b>: ""Actually, I've simplified everything instead of trying to do a lot of things. Earlier when I wasn't getting runs I would try a lot of different things. This year, it's just seeing the ball and hitting the ball. When I play domestically this is the exact kind of situations I go into bat. When Jos bhai and Ash bhai got out, I thought to myself this is what I do in domestic cricket. So that's what I calculated/ [On difference between domestic level and IPL level] I have had three-four years of not performing at all. And you really go back to the hotel room and think when you know you can do it and the results are not coming, you go back to the drawing room. I realised I wasn't practicing at this kind of level so I went and did that. I practiced these kind of quick balls and these kind of scenarios a lot and hence the performances.""</p><p><b>Hardik Pandya</b>: ""We didn't start the way we wanted to, tough night tonight. [On his innings] I think we were in a decent position to give us a chance to get to 150 or 160 but I think my wicket changed the game and brought them more in the game and I think I could have done better. [The pitch] It's good to have something for the bowlers as well. The game is quite cruel to the bowlers. But it was unexpected. It's all about doing the right things. Results, sometimes it happens sometimes it doesn't. I don't think much surprises me anymore. But as a group we believe we can pull off a lot of better things going forward and we just need to be more disciplined and show more courage.""</p><p>Gaurav: ""Does Parag get the Orange Cap, or it remains with Kohli?"" Parag has it now, thanks to a better strike rate than Virat Kohli.</p><p>Mohan: ""MI need to replace Maphaka and Coetzee with Nuvan Thusara and Nabi as their overseas players to make squad stronger.""</p><p>Arjun: ""Two things happened in the last ball of the innings. Coetzee bowled the fastest ball of this IPL at 157 kph and Riyan Parag got 4 runs to get the Orange Cap. "" The latter is correct. The former was a glitch! That was at around 141kph, not 157, even though the TV did show it at 157!</p>"

Cricket is all about batting so looking to contribute more as a batter. That said, I still enjoy by bowling. (On the team joke that he does not attend batting meetings) I have one role and the less I know the better it is for me. (Batting lower down in Abu Dhabi Knight Riders) We had sufficient batters there so I wasn't needed.  At the end of the day it is what the team needs. If they need me to bat, i will bat. (Plan with Salt) He is aggressive and gets the scoring going so all the pressure isn't on me. (As well as you've bowled?) On a wicket like that we wanted to win by a bigger margin so it helps later on in the tournament.""</p><p><B>Winning captain Shreyas Iyer:</b> ""(Did you think about crossing 277?) No no, the way we started we thought 210-220, but 270 was icing on the cake. (Going hard in the powerplay - pre-planned?) As I said in the toss interview, Sunny is there to take on the bowlers, and if he cannot the rest of us should. That's the plan. (Raghuvanshi) He was fearless from ball one. His work ethic is phenomenal. He analyses situations well. He is a smart batter, shots were pleasing to the eye. (Bowling - Starc, Varun with wickets) Good to see bowlers stepping up and taking responsibility. They supported each other in their successes. We've been observing that last few games. (Harshit Rana OK?) Don't know. He was holding the shoulder. I know how he is feeling with shoulders. Will find out. (Vaibhav) The way he came back after conceding two overs early to take wickets. That is the character we need. (Three wins in three) You always have to be down to earth, especially in the IPL.""</p><p>NEW: <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/kkr-vs-dc-ipl-2024-stats-angkrish-raghuvanshi-youngest-to-hit-fifty-on-ipl-debut-as-kkr-hit-second-highest-total-1427672"">All the stats highlights</a> from the KKR batting innings</p><p><B>Mitchell Starc, two wickets tonight:</b> (What worked tonight?) Not changing too much. In T20s, you get some dropped chances and some edges and they don't go your way. But we are 3-0 and that's what it is all about. (Biggest price tag. Struggled with wickets early on) Nothing really as I said before. Games come thick and fast. It is T20 cricket, it can get brutal. You take a bit of luck here and there. We are 3-0, been clinical with the bat, so personal things aside, the team is going fantastic. Nice to have Marsh and Warner in the pocket. Another way win. (Vaibhav Arora and the short ball) That is all him. He was fantastic, using the short ball really well. We talk more in training and in bowling meetings. Just talking about that side of things. They may have questions, we have little conversations, certainly not me telling them what to do.""</p><p>Mustafa Moudi : ""85 with the Bat, A Wicket and excellent Economy Rate with the ball and a Catch as a Fielder. Narine has contributed in every department tonight !!""</p><p><B>Rishabh Pant, losing captain:</b> Our bowlers were all over the place. We just didn't turn up on the day. Today was one of those days. As a batting unit, we only wanted to keep going hard as a team. I would rather get all out as a team than not go for the target. (Some reviews not taken) I think it was quite loud here. At the same time, couldn't see the timer on the screen. There was some problem on the screen. But there are some things you can control, some things you can't. (Use of Axar, only one over) See the thought process was that we didn't want to use spinners but our fast bowlers were going through the motions. I think it is time for reflections as an individual. We need to learn from these mistakes and come positive in the next match. (Pant's own body) Doing fine. Getting out there. Enjoying every day but cricket has its own ups and downs.""</p><p><B>11.18pm</b> So KKR win their first three games, of which two have been away from home! This 106-run win now also sends them to No. 1 on the points table.<BR><BR>There wasn't much pressure for their bowlers after the batters posted 272, and the seamers Starc and Arora very nearly ended the chase in the powerplay. From there on, the Capitals saved some blushes with Pant and Stubbs hitting two attractive half-centuries, but Varun and Narine closed the deal swiftly thereafter. KKR win comfortably after posing the second-highest score in IPL history, stopped from breaking the record only courtesy a terrific Ishant Sharma 20th over in the first innings.</p>

Ashutosh Sharma might come in. But yeah, as Cricfan mentions it seems like a batting XI</p><p>GT Impact Players list: BR Sharath, Mohit Sharma, Sandeep Warrier, Abhinav Manohar, Manav Suthar</p><p><strong>Gujarat Titans</strong>: 1 Shubman Gill (capt), 2 Wriddhiman Saha (wk), 3 Sai Sudharsan, 4 Kane Williamson, 5 Vijay Shankar, 6 Azmatullah Omarzai, 7 Rahul Tewatia, 8 Rashid Khan, 9 Noor Ahmad, 10 Umesh Yadav, 11 Darshan Nalkande</p><p>PBKS Impact Players list: Tanay Thyagarajan, Nathan Ellis, Asutosh Sharma, Rahul Chahar, Vidwath Kaverappa</p><p><strong>Punjab Kings</strong>: 1 Shikhar Dhawan (capt), 2 Jonny Bairstow (wk), 3 Prabhsimran Singh, 4 Sam Curran, 5 Jitesh Sharma (wk),, 6 Shashank Singh, 7 Sikandar Raza, 8 Harpreet Brar, 9 Harshal Patel, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Arshdeep Singh</p><p>Gill: Would've bowled, it's a good wicket. Hopefully it's going to be an exciting contest. We've started pretty well. Got couple games on the road after this.

Few games, the score has gone up but doesn't mean it will be like that every game given all teams are very good. We're playing decent cricket, need ten percent improvement. It's early, got lots of learnings, need to implement them. <strong>Livi goes out due to injury, Raza comes in.</strong></p><p><strong>7pm</strong> Shubman Gill and Shikhar Dhawan are out, both in good spirits too. Gill has the coin, tails is the call. It's tails, Punjab will bowl first</p><p><strong>Pitch</strong>: Square boundaries are 63 metres each. Fine ones are shorter - 55 and 56 metres. Long ones are on the other side - 68 to 70 metres. Simon Katich says it's pitch 6, was used four times last game including the final. Three were won by the chasing team. It has a mix of black and red soil, so it's rock hard. Got 3 millimetres of grass on it, so there'll be a bit of pace and bounce but also runs for batters.  GT have won 8 out of 12 games, so Kings will have a tough challenge. From the sounds of it, my guess is that chasing would be the better. Let's see what the captains think at the toss. Scheduled for 7pm local as always.</p><p>dsk: ""One of the battles to watch out for is the GT's packed Middle order with left handers v Brar and ChaharWoudnlt be easy task for Dhawan this!""</p><p>Mustafa Moudi : ""Exactly around this time last year, Shikhar Dhawan said if he would be the selector, he would choose Gill over himself as the Indian Opener for the World Cup. And within a year Gill has an Orange Cap and now also became the Captain. Really Excited for the battle between the Former Indian Opener vs the Current Indian Opener !!""</p><p><strong>6:40pm</strong> The sky's blue in Ahmedabad but probably not for long. People are peppering in across the stands. The ring-lights on top are on. Practice is going in full flow. The pitch, as the preview mentioned, might be one of red soil. We'll know more about that and the teams soon. If it does have some zip, GT might think of bringing in Spencer Johnson, who looked like a million bucks in the BBL but didn't start as well here. Of course after Mayank Yadav's bursts, raw pace might be worth a try. Kings' spin, actually <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/where-are-punjab-kings-going-wrong-with-the-ball-1427654"">the home bowlers in general</a>, need to step up.

Plan was to give a good start, but I got out early. We lost a few wickets early and Shashank came and played a tremendous knock. When you are chasing a big total, you have to keep the momentum going. Shashank showed his class. Magnificent knock. He timed the ball so nicely, it looked effortless. He kept his cool and finished the game. He started from No. 7 and is now showing his positive mindset. Ashutosh also came in and took the game well. The two young boys were keeping their calm and soaking the pressure.""</p><p><b>Shashank Singh</b>, Player of the Match: ""Still trying to sink in. Visualised all these things, but when it turned into reality, proud of the effort. Coach told me to react to the ball. The wicket is very good, the bounce was good. 200 scored by both teams, so the wicket was fantastic. They are the legends of the game, but when I go to bat I think I am the best. You get experience, couldn't get a lot of matches before. Here the owners and coaching staff backed me. I was very confident.""</p><p><b>11:14pm</b> What drama! Kings finally stall their losing run, and it is the second-highest successful chase against Titans in the IPL. Kings steadily lost wickets at the start but what they did not fail to do was keep up with the asking rate. Prabhsimran and Bairstow first, Jitesh a bit, and then Shashank and Ashutosh at the end kept the hits coming and helped the side hunt down the 200-run target. What a platform the IPL is for these unheralded players. Two of them shine and take their team across the line. Did Titans miss a trick but not bringing in the sixth bowler earlier? Should they have promoted Omarzai with the bat, perhaps ahead of Vijay? Lots to dissect for them.</p><p><b>Shubman Gill</b>, Titans captain, gives Mohit Sharma the Purple Cap: ""Couple of catches went down. Never easy on a wicket like this when you drop catches. Difficult to defend runs in these conditions. The new ball was doing something. There are always areas to improve. I think 200 was good enough. We were in the game till the 15th over. When you drop catches, you will be in trouble. The way Nalkande bowled in the last match, we went to him for the last over. This is IPL for you - people who you have not seen will come and win games.""</p><p><b>Ashutosh Sharma</b>: ""I would like to thank Punjab Kings for believing in me. Happy that our team has won. Personal performance happens, but main thing is for the team to win. [Mindset] Shikhar [Dhawan] has told me a lot of things mentally. I was like 'I will do it'. I have won games for my team, so I had the belief. Sanjay Bangar also believed in me, he spoke to me a lot during camps, and that helped. Back home, I had worked with Amay Khurasiya, my coach. He said you will do well when you get the chance.""</p>"

Two changes for them. Mayank Agarwal is not feeling well says Cummins so Nitish will play. Natarajan is also back from injury. For CSK, there are three changes. <strong>Mustafizur is not around, and Pathirana also has a niggle</strong> says Gaikwad. <strong>Moeen Ali, Maheesh Theekshana and Mukesh Choudhary</strong> come into the side.</p><p><strong>Pat Cummins:</strong> Few games, still trying to get my head around the impact player. Consistency is the key. Mayank is feeling unwell and Nitish is in. Nattu is back from injury. It looks like a good wicket. </p><p>Huge cheers for <strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad</strong>. Home crowd anyone? ""So far so good, last game we were close,"" he says. ""Everyone is in good head space. For me, I have done captaincy, nothing new for me. I just want to be myself and just take thing forward. Fizz is absent, Pathirana has slight niggle as well. Mo comes in Theekshana comes in and Mukesh comes in. Big miss for us [Fizz]. The bowlers are rearing to go regardless. </p><p><strong>Not long before the toss</strong></p><p><b>Pitch report</b>: One side is slightly bigger than the other - both square boundaries are 70m and the straight boundary is longer, says Samuel Badree. It's a different surface to the 277 game, says Lara. ""More visible cracks but that won't make a difference,"" he says. ""The captain should bat first and put a big total. If you get 200 here, you should think you have done well. Pace on the ball will help earlier but it is a flat track and batters should do well.""</p><p>Vineeth Nalluri: ""Since Fizz isn't available, I would bring Santner in his place and replace Rizvi with Shardul.""</p><p>Mustafa Moudi : ""Unpopular Opinion: Reaching 270s twice within a week is too boring. T20 is slowly turning into a Baseball, i.e. Six Hitting Competition. This is just increasing Batsman personal records and Bowlers Economy with their fault. We need a proper contest between the bat and the ball !!""</p><p><strong>6.50pm</strong> Dhoni has just walked out on to the park and Uppal has gone berserk. Absolute bedlam in the stands. Just what the sighting of one man can do. He's warming up with some light football. while Cummins is doing some batting practice. He'll hope he is not needed today. For all the euphoria, this game is crucial for both sides, who are coming off a loss. SRH <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/gujarat-titans-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-12th-match-1422130/full-scorecard"">went down to Gujarat Titans</a> by seven wickets, and have won just one game out of three. CSK after winning their first two games, lost to Capitals <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/delhi-capitals-vs-chennai-super-kings-13th-match-1422131/full-scorecard"">by 20 runs</a> despite Dhoni's whirlwind knock. They will want to get back to winning ways. As far as the head to head is concerned, CSK are firm favourites having won <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/CSK-against-SRH&tournament=ipl"">14 out of 19 games</a> played between the two sides. They, however, will be without their spearhead Mustafizur Rahman for this game.</p><p>Here's <strong>Travis Head</strong> talking to Harsha Bhogle on air: [Any orange around?] Scattered a little bit. I have heard things about Chennai. If Dhoni walks down now, I might lose you. [277 surface] The wicket was nice, we are making sure we start well ,give ourselves the best chance. Hopefully we can get off to a good start. [Going after his shots] It is situational. I am always giving myself a chance. My technique is of a three-format player. I try to use my experience. [Coming to Hyderabad] Have been here a couple of times in the last 12 months, and have done well, so hope to do better. [Surface] I had a look at the surface a couple of days out it looks quite good. Try to come in with plans, assess the conditions, is it swinging, is it not. We tried to do that a couple of days ago and will try to make the right decisions. [Score 277 again?] Tough game to follow. We need to have the same intent, and give ourselves the best chance.</p><p><strong>6.40pm</strong> Sixes flew, records broke, the balls went out shape the last time an IPL game took <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-mumbai-indians-8th-match-1422126/full-scorecard"">place in Hyderabad</a>. SRH amassed 277, the highest-ever score in the history of IPL, while Mumbai Indians were not far off in their chase reaching 246. So, what's in store today? More of the same according to <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-chennai-super-kings-18th-match-1422136/match-preview"">Shashank Kishore in his preview</a>. For SRH, Abhishek Sharma has set the tempo at the top and Travis Head has already shown how dangerous he can be in that game against Mumbai . Then there's Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen in unbelievable six-hitting form. CSK too have a prolific six-hitter in Shivam Dube, who has struck at 177.09 against spin since last year's IPL while they also see Daryl Mitchell warming up to a similar role. And then, of course, there is <i>Thala</i>, who blazed away to an unbeaten 16-ball 37 in his last game against DC. We might be in for an epic clash tonight.</p>

But, mind you this is a very different surface to the one that was laid out in the earlier game. Barring Shivam Dube, who hammered 45 off 24, no batter really got going. The SRH bowlers were meticulous with their strategies. They took the pace off and didn't give CSK anything to work with. Can SRH batters chase this down?

Shivam was hitting the spinners. So we took a chance with the fast bowlers bowling cutters. [Abhishek Sharma] I would not be wanting to be bowling to him. The crowd is crazy tonight, especially when MS walked out. We love playing here, home conditions.""</p><p><b>Abhishek Sharma</b>, Player of the Match: ""In the bowling we felt it was a slow wicket. So we wanted to take the powerplay on. We had a chance to prepare well before the IPL. We knew it will be slow but not if we take on the bowler. Because it would be difficult for the bowler as well. Big scores matter, but I went with the flow today. Hopefully I will get out last next time. It is all the hardwork i have put before this. Special thanks to my dad, Yuvi <i>paaji</i> and Brian Lara.""</p><p><b>10:49pm</b> One-way traffic in Hyderabad tonight. But CSK did not leave it without a fight. Given the start SRH had, they could have well romped home earlier. Head and Abhishek are turning out to be some pairing. They never let the opposition in, unless they commit a mistake. Tonight was also something similar. Head was offered a life in the first over and then CSK were senton a leather hunt. SRH romped to 78 for 1 in the powerplay in the chase. And you almost knew that was the game.</p><p><b>Ruturaj Gaikwad</b>, CSK captain: ""It was a slow pitch. At the back end they bowled well. We couldn't capitalise in the last five overs. We were in a good situation halfway but they bowled well at the back. Black soil pitch, so we expected the slowness. As the ball got older, it got slower. They used the conditions well - big boundary one end. We did not bowl well in the powerplay but did well to drag the game. 170-175 is par, if we would have had a good powerplay with the ball, we could have had the game. There was slight dew at the later stage. Moeen was spinning the ball in the 15th-16th over, so not much of a difference.""</p><p><b>Aiden Markram</b>: ""Not too bad, but not like it was against Mumbai. When we bowled, the first ten overs or so, it was coming on alright but got tougher. So we took on in the first ten and were in a good position later. I don't want to think too much, probably see-ball, hit-ball. That is encouraged by the team management and Patty [Pat Cummins]. When you get in, the batter that is in needs to value the position. The Impact Player has freed batters.""</p><p>Rajkumar Lingav: ""Klassen finishes without hitting a Six!!! ""</p><p>Nishant: ""SRH wasted a great opportunity to improve their NRR. The middle period they went into a shell unnecessarily! No RR pressure, no wickets pressure "" Wasn't a very easy surface to hit through and through, and that reflected.</p>"

Square ones are 63 and 69 metres far. WV Raman says it's a hard pitch, has grass, is well prepared. Batters will make runs. It offers more turn for spinners than other grounds. There is a bit of patchy grass which will help them along with the big boundaries. It's an open ground, so dew might not be a big issue. </p><p><b>Ask Star on ESPNcricinfo</b>: Got a question for the Star Sports commentators about this match?

Home hasn't been kind to them and Rajasthan Royals are trying to re-establish Jaipur as their fortress but going back on the road could be the welcome change the visitors need, especially their big-name batters Faf du Plessis, Glenn Maxwell, and Cameron Green. They have Karn Sharma and Maxwell in the ranks but aren't strong in the spin department. Alzarri Joseph, their fast-bowling big buy, got pumped. But Reece Topley brings height and the left-armer's angle with him. Can things click together, which seems to be the only mode in which RCB can thrive this season?</p>",

<p><strong>9:11pm</strong> 183 - It's roughly around par but are they short though? Okay, three minutes and the Kohli chat later, one thing's clear - conditions can't not be factored in. As he said, they had to hit straight and couldn't get under balls. Faf tried pretty much everything but couldn't shake it off. Kohli had a great start to the powerplay. Ashwin coming in slowed things down. He and Chahal were excellent. They used the lack of bounce well and the pace, which wasn't true all the time. The openers then consolidated for a while, put on 125. RCB promoted Maxwell and Chauhan but couldn't get much. Kohli though, was like a motivated bike rider in Bangalore traffic. Knew which <em>gullies</em> to go through and where to accelerate. It might not be enough but he's given them a chance.</p><p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong>: The wicket looks different from up there when you're not playing the ball yourself. It seems flat. But when you see the ball holding up in the pitch, especially against the spinners you see pace is changing quickly. Big dimensions come into play. Our initial target was 195 but then we decided if one of me or Faf got out one had to bat till the end. We got a boost and got 185, which I feel this is an effective total. If we get the change of pace and lengths right, it will be a tough chase. I'm not coming in with premeditation. I was 12 off 10, I don't want to be over-aggressive, want to keep the bowler guessing. They want me to go hard and get me out. It's just experience and maturity. I play the conditions and have the game ready. Doesn't seem there's dew hope it's the same. Balls didn't come on to bad, felt you couldn't get under bat.</p><p>Durvank: ""In days of 200s, 183 seems little short...""</p>"

Four games, four wins, but they know from recent memory that a good beginning is no guarantee of going deep into the IPL. As for RCB, well, lots of problems to dwell on and sort out. Before that, though, we have a tasty double-header coming up tomorrow: MI vs DC first up, and then LSG vs GT. Two potential crackers, so do be there to follow all the action on your favourite website. Until then, good night!</p><p><b>Jos Buttler, Player of the Match</b>: ""A little bit of luck to get it over the rope in the end, didn't time it that well, but delighted to get the win. However long you've played the game, you still have those anxieties and stresses. Sometimes you just have to tell yourself it'll be okay. Just keep digging in, working hard, at some point we will be okay. I actually did feel really good in the last game, even though I only scored 13 or something. We've started this season really well. We've been together for three seasons, everyone's comfortable with each other, we just need to keep this momentum going.""</p><p><b>Sanju Samson</b>: ""I think anything below 190, with a little bit of dew coming in, with the batting order we have, I felt it was a good total to chase. Touchwood, few more games to go, we are bowling well. And we have got a break, which is helping us charge up and come in fresh. [Are RR a batting or bowling side?] I think bowling is 9, and batting is 8.7. It was just a matter of time with Jos. He just needed to get through the powerplay and middle a few balls.""</p><p><b>Kumar Sangakkara</b>: ""I thought it was a good toss to win, we were pretty decisive in wanting to chase. RCB started well, but Nandre Burger brought us back with the spinners, and Jos and Sanju were clinical. Everyone requires a chat, but the chat doesn't have to be about cricket or technique or anything like that. Jos is the best white-ball opener in the world, and all he needed to do was sit back and ignore some of the noise. [On Jaiswal:] We know the quality that Jaiswal brings to the side, we just want him to relax and bat, and bat long. He just needs to calm down a little bit, rest up.""</p><p><b>Faf du Plessis</b>: ""I think batting out there with Virat, we found the wicket really tricky and low. We did feel 190 would be a good score. I did feel we could have maximised 10 or 15 more towards the end. It was a good toss to win, you did see that it played much nicer with the dew. Virat was playing really well at the back end. Whether it was Virat or a Greeny or a DK coming in, we could have scored a few more. We tried, but it was quite tricky to hit. With the spinners, a lot of balls were hitting the bottom of the bat. I think the pitch definitely got better. That's what dew does, that's the nature of the wicket. I thought it was a good toss for them to win. We started well in the first four overs, then the one over from our spinners, 20 runs, it shifted the pressure back onto us. Maxwell, all the right-handers batting in the middle, that's why I went to the left-arm spinner, Mayank, who's been bowling well for us this season. And the legspinner [Himanshu], you want to use the attacking option. When we got the wicket of Jaiswal, with the two right-handers in the middle, it didn't feel like the right time to use the offspinner.""</p><p><b>11.08pm</b> Terrific win for the Royals. It seems like a long time ago, but RCB began brilliantly with the bat before the Royals spinners began turning things around to restrict them to 183. It didn't feel like enough then, despite what Virat Kohli said about the conditions, particularly with all the doubts over RCB's bowling quality. Royals did it easily in the end, with a brilliant century from a back-among-the-runs Jos Buttler, and a superb 69 from Sanju Samson.</p>"

A side that has fallen short at the Eliminator twice in succession, against an outfit that has reached the final in both years of its existence. A team with lofty ambitions, up against a franchise that has already gotten to where LSG would want to be. </p><p>In one corner, a power-packed batting unit, studded with stars throughout; in the other, an ensemble cast that continues to do what is asked of them. On one side, there is a young fast bowler, all of 2 IPL games old, terrorizing batters with his raw pace. And in the opposition, a veteran who keeps unfurling his bag of tricks with guile, poise and precision. </p><p>Then, there is a captain who is relatively experienced in the IPL (and has led India), and another who has just started out. A team that could barely win at home, against a side that travelled so well in 2023 (winning six out of their seven away league fixtures). </p><p>This might seem a contest of contrasts.

<p><strong>9:14pm</strong> And so, LSG stutter and stumble their way to 163. They were rocked early, losing de Kock and Padikkal to Umesh. Rahul and Stoinis then resurrected the innings. The former, though, was probably too cautious, scratching his way to 33 off 31 and perishing when he attempted a big stroke.</p><p>Stoinis fared better and registered a fifty, but he too could not carry on and give LSG the finishing kick they were after. Pooran did manage a 22-ball 32, while Badoni scored 20 off 11. But LSG, at this stage, will feel they have left a few runs out there.</p><p>As for GT, they will be largely pleased with their bowling effort. Umesh set the tone early and the spinners followed suit. Nalkande was a tad expensive but he did account for Stoinis and Rahul, which meant LSG were never able to generate the head of steam they were after. GT will be confident of chasing down 164, but they will also be mindful of the fact that LSG have never lost when defending 160-plus. Join us in a bit for the run-chase!</p><p><b>Umesh Yadav:</b> (On his animated celebrations) The way the games are coming, and how I am bowling with the new ball, this was the first time I got two wickets back-to-back in the powerplay. What I worked on before the match, it worked out, so I was happy. My plan was to swing the ball. I feel that if the ball swings and if you can stick to your lines and lengths, that is the best way to get dismissals. That was what I was trying - to bowl in the right areas and to get it to swing. The wicket is a little spongy and there was a little bit of dew. I feel this (score) should be chaseable.</p>"

We will be back again tomorrow as the Chennai Super Kings return to Chepauk, hoping to snap their two-game losing streak, against a Kolkata Knight Riders side that is firing on all cylinders. Until then, this is me (Shashwat) signing off on behalf of Sudeep and everyone else at ESPNcrcinfo. Goodnight and take care! </p><p><b>Yash Thakur, Player of the Match:</b> I am very happy with my first five-wicket haul and my first POTM award. (On bowling to Gill) The plan we had for Gill, we had two fielders on the leg side. So, we sort of knew that he (Gill) would try to make room. Rahul bhaiya told me to stick to my plans and that we will get a wicket that way. Unfortunate for us that Mayank picked up an injury. But Rahul bhaiya told me that this is my day and that I will win the game for LSG. In the last two seasons, we had not won against them. We won today so we are very happy. (On which wicket was his favourite) Shubman's wicket. </p><p><b>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants captain:</b> (On LSG making defending totals an art) We will take the win. Not going to make too much out of it. For the young bowing group we have, helps when we bat first and they can assess the conditions. They have been adapting really well, so credit to them. (On not losing a game when defending 160-plus) It is a good record to have. But it is where we have played. We know how the wickets were, very low-scoring wicket and low-scoring ground. Having the home advantage obviously helps a bit. The same guys were playing last season as well, they have adjusted their roles and they are reading the wicket well. That is something I try to speak to them about in the nets and in practice, to help them make the right choices when the pressure is on. Hopefully we can continue. (Thoughts at the half-way stage) We knew very early that it (the pitch) was not as good as the other day. We were not trying to get to a particular score, and were just trying to bat and see how many we would get. We put up a score and then you expect the bowlers to do their job. All three spinners have been key for us. Sid (Siddharth) has done very well, he bowls a crucial part when he bowls with the new ball. He has shown great temperament and he has given us steady bowling in the first 2-3 overs. He has picked up wickets, but his job is to restrict runs. KP (Krunal Pandya) has played for so many years, and he is smart and knows how to bowl. Have played with Bishnoi also for a lot of years. Feels good to get off the mark (against the Titans). </p><p><b>Shubman Gill, Gujarat Titans captain:</b> (On the conditions) I think it was a good wicket to bat on. just a poor batting performance by us. We got off to a decent start but we lost it in the middle overs and were never able to recover from that. (On the bowling) I think our bowlers were exceptional to restrict them to that score. We were looking at 170-180 but to restrict them, it was a tremendous effort. (On Miller) He is a player who can change the game at any time. We had a couple of injuries but irrespective, this total was gettable. (On his dismissal) It was the last over of the powerplay and I just wanted to capitalise. Everyone was up on the off side, I wanted to give himself room. The ball I got out to, I was trying to play it too square and missed it. (On Umesh Yadav) He is definitely someone who is very experienced. Darshan and everyone in the bowling attack did a good job. </p><p><b>Krunal Pandya:</b> When I went in, I just played a couple of balls. I was having a chat with Pooran and the wicket was very good, and we felt we were 10-15 runs short. At the end of the day, what I do is knowing the batter's strengths and weaknesses and bowling according to that. On some days, it works. On others it does not. One of those days where I was able to execute what I wanted. It feels great the way we have been defending in the entire tournament. It gives that extra confidence. But see, at the end of the day, you have to go there every day and execute your plans and we have done well so far. (On Mayank Yadav's injury) I don't know what is happening. I had a brief chat and he seemed okay, which is a positive. Whatever conversation I have had, whatever we see, he has a good head on his shoulder. Really excited to see how his carer pans out.  </p><p><strong>11:11pm</strong> At the half-way stage, it might have seemed the Super Giants were a little par. As it turned out, they weren't, and much of it was down to how well they bowled. They were put under pressure early, with Gill and Sudharsan getting the Titans off to a decent start. Once the latter fell to Thakur on the final ball of the powerplay, though, things went south for the 2022 champions.</p><p>None of their middle-order batters got going, and they kept finding ways to get out. Williamson perished to a sensational catch, while some of the other batters' shot selection left a bit to be desired. Tewatia got a few boundaries away towards the end but that only reduced the margin of defeat, rather than acting as a catalyst for a turnaround.</p><p>Coming back to LSG, Thakur picked up his career-best IPL figures, finishing with a five-wicket haul. Krunal was also very impressive, giving away only 11 runs in four overs and accounting for three batters. Bishnoi and Naveen also chipped in, ensuring that LSG, once they got the momentum in their bowling innings, never relented.</p>"

<p><b>11.01pm </b> CSK have turned a banana peel of a chase into an absolute cruise at dewy Chepauk. Ravindra Jadeja led their turnaround after KKR set themselves up superbly in the Powerplay, and then with the bat, Gaikwad and Mitchell laid the foundation of a chase that they were always in control of. And that means, KKR have been consigned to their first defeat this season.</p><p><B> Ravindra Jadeja is PoM for his 3/18. </b> ""My title hasn't yet been verified, hopefully they'll give me one [laughs]. I always enjoy my bowling on this track. I was hoping the ball grips a little, if you bowl in the right areas with helps you. For visiting teams it takes time to settle in and plan, you hardly get 2-3 days, for a visiting team to come here, play and identify the surface is little difficult. We know our conditions better.""</p><p><B> Ruturaj Gaikwad: </b> Bit of nostalgia for me. My first IPL fifty, Mahi bhai was with me to finish the match. With Jinx injured, onus was on me to bat through, didn't want to put the youngsters in a difficult situation. Was a 150-160 wicket. Jaddu always comes in after the power play with momentum in the spin department. With this team, I don't really need to tell things to anyone. Everyone's in a great head space, Mahi bhai and Fleming are still around to take those calls. I wouldn't say mine is a slow start, in T20s there are times you nick off one or two balls, sometimes you need a bit of luck to get going, maybe something for experts to talk about, with my strike rate (laughs).""</p><p><b> Daryl Mitchell:</b> ""Always nice to play in front of a special crowd, pretty cool. When you know surface is on the slower side, it's about building a partnership and take it as deep as we could. He's world class, for me it's coming up with plans to put pressure on those guys. The way Rutu got the job out there was amazing to see. There was a bit of turn and bounce, for us it was about building partnerships and allow ourselves into a position to finish it off. I don't mind wherever I bat, here to win games of cricket and get the job done.</p><p><b> Shreyas Iyer, tonight's losing captain: </b> It's deafening out here, will try to express how I'm feeling. We fell short in terms of assessing the wicket. Phenomenal start in the power play but we couldn't capitalize. Couldn't assess conditions, pitch completely changed after power play and to score runs, it wasn't easy. They know conditions pretty well, bowled according to their plan. It was tacky, wasn't easy to go big right from first ball. It changed tremendously after power play and the way we were trying to construct our innings, didn't go to plan. We take those learnings and move forward. We were in a comfortable place, thought 160-170 was a great score. That was our plan but when you lose consecutive wickets it's difficult to carry forward momentum. Have to go back to our drawing board and learn, just a matter of one match and one innings, glad it happened at the start of the tournament. When we go back, we know our home conditions pretty well, important to analyze and assess situations and make the best use of it.</p>"
